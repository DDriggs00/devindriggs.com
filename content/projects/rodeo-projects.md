## TV Middleware

The TV Middleware is a piece of customer/TV Set-Top Box management and billing software, divided into a separate server and client. This project is under a proprietary license at RodeoTV, and no source code is available.

### Server

The server component is written in Python/Django Rest Framework. It performs all data management and is accessed via a Rest API. The server integrates with several other services over their APIs.

### Client

The client component is written in Typescript/Angular, and was inherited from a previous developer. It allows for easy and intuitive use of functions that are available through the server API.

## PHP software modification

I took over maintenance of a piece of PHP software from a previous developer, and made several large changes, greatly expanding a Rest API

Unfortunately, all projects completed at RodeoTV are closed-source, so no repo is available
